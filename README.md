### Express Route Code Challenges

### General information

*metalArray.js* - Using app.get() we created the route that sends back the array of metal building materials.

*battlefieldObject.js* - Using app.get() and req.params.name we created a route that sends back the battlefield object.

*currencies.js* - Using app.put(), req.params.name and req.query we updated array of countries that use certain currency. The :name param represents the currency name in the currencies object. The route handler replaces the countries array of the correct single-currency object with an updated array from the query. It sends the updated array as a response.
